1.First, you have to download a VS Code application From the following link:
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Note that you can do this work from any other code editor also. But I definitely would recommend you to use VS Code.

2.Second,you have to Copy this code or download this code and paste it to any file keeping the file extension same. Then open the code with VS Code .You can search for any youtube tutorial for doing these works. Youtube videos are available for these.

3.Last but not the least, run the files and edit and explore the project as much as you want.
