Motivation:muslimHack is here to make easy all the things those a muslim feels trouble to do.We have noticed that through the popular social media ‘facebook’, one can be updated with the recent issues and the scholar also can distribute their knowledge. But it’s not something feasible,because it causes harm more than benefit.It kills our valuable times by making us involved in many things.besides,in our practicing society,it’s really very tough to find a practicing muslim to get marry which is a must.So we decided to make this website where one can come and do so many islamic courses and workshops,ask fatwas to our scholars,can read and download beneficial books,can donate money and also can get economical help,chat with us,contact with us and most importantly can search for his perfect one!
